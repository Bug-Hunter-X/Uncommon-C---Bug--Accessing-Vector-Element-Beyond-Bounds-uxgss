This repository demonstrates a common C++ error related to accessing vector elements outside of the valid index range. The bug involves iterating through a vector without checking if it is empty or if the index is within the bounds of the vector's size.

The solution illustrates proper error handling by first checking if the vector is empty. This prevents undefined behavior and potential crashes.
